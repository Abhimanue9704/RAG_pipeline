Security Guidelines

Incident Response:
In the event of a suspected security breach, employees must immediately notify the Security Operations Team. The team can be contacted via the internal incident hotline or email.

Data Handling:
Sensitive customer data must be encrypted both at rest and in transit. Employees should only access data necessary for their role.

Device Security:
All company laptops must have full-disk encryption enabled. Devices should automatically lock after 5 minutes of inactivity.

Third-Party Access:
Vendors and contractors must follow the same security requirements as employees and are subject to periodic audits.
